# Sports Odds Project
My personal project examining the predictive value of bets offered by bookies.

## Abstract
During the superbowl I was reading about the exploding popularity of the sports gambling industry. I became curious about how the industry worked and more importantly how accurate sports books are at predicting sports outcomes. I always admired sports from a data science perspective -- it is an industry swimming in data.

## Research Question

How accurate are sports book at predicting the outcomes of sporting events?

For detailed analyses, [see here](https://github.com/kakurk/SportsOdds/blob/main/04_glmPredict.md) and [here](https://github.com/kakurk/SportsOdds/blob/main/05_longshot_favorite_bias_simulation.md).

The TL;DR -- sports books are remakebly good at predicting the outcomes of sporting events. They appear to build in a ~2% profit margin into their bets. They also appear to make more money on long-shot bets.

Some caveats: the analyses were run with sports book available in the NY area on the outcomes of NFL games. These conclusions may not apply to other sports, other betting markets, or to other sports books.
